- 👋 Hi, I’m Dhruv
- 👀 I’m thinking about changing my current field of career, i have always wanted to be a soft developer but lets say becuase of my choices in the past i got knocked into the field that i never wanted to be in the first place, but hey better late then never.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python as my first programming language and dont want to stop learning at all.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that help me build my portfolio that alternate the requirements for a degree in CS, i have already two degrees of engineering in mechanical one bachelor and second advance diploma
- 📫 How to reach me ... email : pateldhruv86956@gmail.com
